## Mobile Concert Hall.

The R8 II is tuned in keeping with the “Portable Concert Hall” ethos of the original R8, but takes one step further, in filling out the large soundstage projected by the series with a new level of detail and density, truly bringing the openess and power of an orchestral performance into a portable listening environment, all thanks to the all-new Darwin-MPA architecture. 

The Darwin-MPA (Multiphase PWM Array) continues the flexible design of Darwin-R2R, having most of the same distinguishing features as Darwin-R2R. To work with the internal delta-sigma modulators, input signals
are oversampled to 128x via the flexibleDarwin v2 filter system (which may optionally emulate various types of non-oversampling DAC functionality via the 3 built-in NOS filtersor follow a hybrid approach via the built-in
Darwin Ultra filter). The oversampling (or non-oversampling) processing follows a cascaded FIR design with a highly precise 1024-tap opening stage.

16-way current mode DAC coupled with I-V conversion and lowpass of output stage creates more detailed soundstage with good power efficiency.
