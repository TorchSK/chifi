title: Hiby R8 II

description: The R8 II adheres to the original R8's "Portable Concert Hall" philosophy but takes it a step further by enriching the expansive soundstage with a heightened level of detail and density. This advancement truly brings the openness and power of an orchestral performance to a portable listening setting, thanks to the innovative Darwin-MPA architecture. The Darwin-MPA, a continuation of the flexible design found in Darwin-R2R, shares many distinguishing features with its predecessor. In conjunction with internal delta-sigma modulators, input signals undergo 128x oversampling through the adaptable Darwin v2 filter system. This system can optionally emulate various non-oversampling DAC functionalities via the three built-in NOS filters or adopt a hybrid approach with the built-in Darwin Ultra filter. The oversampling (or non-oversampling) process follows a cascaded FIR design, featuring a highly precise 1024-tap opening stage.
