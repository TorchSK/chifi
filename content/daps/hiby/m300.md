title: Hiby M300

description: Not everyone desires multi-channel D/A converters and powerful amplifiers. Some simply seek a well-controllable player with a headphone output, whose sound quality surely surpasses ordinary phones, and whose battery lasts even on long journeys without recharging. That's exactly what the "stripped-down" HiRes player HiBy M300 offers. The player runs on modern Android 13, easily handles any streaming services, and allows the installation of apps from Google Play. At normal volume, it can handle almost 30 hours of playback, and its powerful processor copes with HiRes resolution recordings up to 768 kHz and DSD 256. The device's internal memory is a practical 32 GB.
