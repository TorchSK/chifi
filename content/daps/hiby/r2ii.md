title: Hiby R2 II

description: Much more than just a small player. The second generation of the miniature HiBy R2 player pushes the boundaries of what to expect from pocket players. In addition to WiFi + BT 5.0 with top codecs, you can now also count on QOBUZ streaming support and increased power of 2 x 90 mW. Moreover, the volume control for the novelty is conveniently set with a wheel instead of older buttons. The player is also built around the newer ES9219C D/A converter, supporting higher bitrate (384 kHz) and DSD 256. Of course, it also supports MQA 8x format for streaming TIDAL service in HiRes quality.
