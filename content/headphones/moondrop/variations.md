description: Advanced transducer unit and rigorous acoustic structure design, coupled with carefully polished physical filtering and crossover circuits, make Variations outstanding results in both linear and nonlinear distortions. Phase exhibits a high degree of uniformity across all the frequency, eliminating the common connection problems of multi-unit tribrid earphones, making the three-frequency sound fit accurately, and the sound field image is true and accurate. With the reasonable unit configuration, the total harmonic distortion of the whole frequency is less than 1%, and the odd and even harmonics are evenly distributed, and the overall tone is harmonious and clean.

## Diaphragm Dynamic Driver

Diaphragm dynamic driver is also called electric electro-acoustic
transducer, and its manufacturing principle is that it can produce
displacement by energizing conductor in a constant magnetic field.

## Balanced Armature Driver 

The balanced armature electro-acoustic transducer is mainly composed of vibrating ferromagnetism and coil parts fixed in the magnet
ic circuit. It fenerates an alternating magnetic filed when the alterna
ing current passes the coil, resulting in the stress of the armature or
metal diaphragm in the magnetic circuit change and vibrate.

## Electrostatic Driver

Electrostatic driver is also commonly referred to as the capacitive
electroacoustic transducer. Its diaphragm is driven by the repulsive
force of the electrostatic field to produce sound.

## Seek for the perfect compatibility of Tribrid IEM

Since the application of electrostatic driver for in-ear
earphones, products with electrostatic units have emerged
one after another, but they have been criticized for reasons
such as "unacceptable tone” or "difficult to drive".
The development of Variations adopts our previous
experience in the development of EST + BA hybrid ond EST +
DD hybrid earphones. 


With 3D printing, a precise physical
filter structure and frequency divider circuit are
manufactured to produce excellent amplitude-frequency
response and phase-frequency response. Conveys the
perfect harmony of the sound and imaging.
