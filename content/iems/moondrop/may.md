title: Moondrop May

description: The Moondrop MAY headphones represent an exceptional concept of dual-driver in-ear monitors with a USB-C connector. They connect to a phone or laptop via the digital USB-C connector, which transmits only pure data, while the precise sound processing is handled by a DAC with interactive DSP sound control directly on the headphone cable. Regardless of the phone used, you can enjoy the full potential of the headphones up to HiRes resolution of 384 kHz / 32 bit. A mature and precisely balanced sound delivery is managed by a dual system that combines the advantages of a dynamic and planar driver. Both drivers are placed on the same axis, and while the dynamic driver with flexible suspension primarily operates in the bass and treble range, the precise 6-millimeter planar driver can focus solely on the highest frequencies from 8 kHz.
