title: Moondrop Variations

description: Advanced transducer unit and rigorous acoustic structure design, coupled with carefully polished physical filtering and crossover circuits, make Variations outstanding results in both linear and nonlinear distortions. Phase exhibits a high degree of uniformity across all the frequency, eliminating the common connection problems of multi-unit tribrid earphones, making the three-frequency sound fit accurately, and the sound field image is true and accurate. With the reasonable unit configuration, the total harmonic distortion of the whole frequency is less than 1%, and the odd and even harmonics are evenly distributed, and the overall tone is harmonious and clean.
