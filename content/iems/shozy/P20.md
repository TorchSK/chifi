title: Shozy P20

description: The Shozy P20 features a large diaphragm dynamic driver, specifically a 14.5mm planar magnetic driver, which is significantly larger than typical IEM drivers. This larger driver size results in greater sonic output with reduced total harmonic distortion (THD) across the frequency spectrum, particularly improving bass response. The manufacturing process ensures minimal channel imbalance. The tuning of the P20 is aimed at showcasing the power of the large driver, offering powerful and textured sub-bass and bass response while maintaining a balanced and natural overall tonal balance for a professional sound signature. Additionally, the P20 includes an interchangeable cable system with 0.78mm 2-pin connections and options for both 3.5mm unbalanced and 4.4mm balanced cable jacks, making it compatible with a variety of music devices.
