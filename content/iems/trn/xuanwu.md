title: TRN Xuanwu

description: The TRN XuanWu takes its name from the Black Tortoise, a symbol representing the combination of movement and stillness in Chinese astronomy. Featuring a distinctive 10mm square planar driver developed by Bellsing, it offers powerful bass and warm vocals, catering to daily music listeners. This driver harmonizes frequencies effectively, blending dynamic and conventional planar driver strengths.Constructed with an aluminum alloy faceplate and semi-permeable resin shell, the XuanWu is both compact and durable, boasting a classy, premium appearance. Its 4-core cable, made of pure copper and silver-plated copper, enhances sound output width and detail resolution, with gold-plated connectors available in 3.5mm, 2.5mm, and 4.4mm. The groundbreaking Bellsing driver allows for planar magnetic technology in headphones, previously restricted to larger speakers and amplifiers, yet the XuanWu maintains a low 12Ω impedance, ensuring compatibility with smartphones and other devices for excellent audio performance.
