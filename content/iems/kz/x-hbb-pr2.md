title: KZ x HBB PR2

description: KZ PR2 is equipped with a newly developed 13.2mm real planar unit. It completely cancels the voice coil structure and is replaced by ultra-low resistance nano-silver electroplating lines. The low-load diaphragm brings faster response speed and better high-frequency performance, which is the advantage of the real plane unit.
