title: KZ x HBB PR2

description: Unique planar headphones with an excellent price/performance ratio. The KZ x HBB PR2 is a very successful model of monitors with a magnetic planar sound unit. These are exceptional headphones that match the performance of significantly more expensive models from other brands with their features. The 13.2mm planar driver is tuned across the entire frequency spectrum. Compared to traditional dynamic drivers, it has faster response and better performance in the high frequencies. The KZ planar unit is at the highest current technological level, equipped with a 7+7 N52 rubidium magnetic field with a silver-plated nanometer membrane. The side wall made of dense aluminum alloy gives the headphones an exclusive appearance. The headphones fit well in the ears due to the ergonomic design and pleasantly smooth resin body. The package includes a high-quality cable made of oxygen-free copper with silver plating. The cable is equipped with a microphone and button. The package also includes one pair of memory foam ear tips and 3 pairs of silicone ear tips in different sizes.
