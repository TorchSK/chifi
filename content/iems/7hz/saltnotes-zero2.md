title: 7hz Saltnotes Zero:2

description: The enhanced Salnotes Zero undergoes a transformation, featuring an improved 10mm dynamic driver in-ear monitor (IEM) that delivers heightened bass and midrange. The original's tonal balance is preserved, while an additional 3dB in low frequencies enhances the overall bass experience, ensuring both detail and enjoyment. With a new dynamic driver boasting a PU+Metal composite diaphragm, updated crossover circuitry, and upgraded materials for the case and cable, this goes beyond a mere retuneâ€”it represents a comprehensive upgrade.
