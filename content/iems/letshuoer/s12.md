## Ergonomic design details
The earphone connector protrudes slightly from the side of the IEM so the earhook on the cable can sit comfortably on the ear without twisting inwards. The receptor is slightly indented into the chassis to ensure product longevity as well.

## Dual vent hole design
The chassis has two vent holes drilled to the side of the unit to reduce pressure against the ear drums, which in turns protect users’ hearing.
