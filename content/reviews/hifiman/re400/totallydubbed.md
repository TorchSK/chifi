title: Hifiman RE 400 Waterline

reviewer: totallydubbed.net

description: Overall, I can’t recommend these, mainly due to their sound quality. I just can’t justify paying £76 for these, when there are cheaper and even equally priced earphones that completely blow the RE-400s out the water.

score: 7.5
