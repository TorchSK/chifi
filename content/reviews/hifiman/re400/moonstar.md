title: Hifiman RE 400 Waterline

reviewer: moonstarreviews.net

description: The Hifiman RE400 is very lightweight and comfortable to wear In-Ear Monitor with a smooth and relaxing presentation. The nice vocal performance will make the RE400 to a real joy, especially with acoustic songs, while listeners who prefer more bass in their tracks will be less satisfied.

score: "?"
