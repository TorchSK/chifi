title: Letshuoer S12 Pro

reviewer: Headfonia.com

description: Build quality is great, design is mild but comfort is very good, and for less than two hundred bucks, you get a very compelling sound, with solid lows, clean mids and great staging, in a life-lasting shell. If I didnâ€™t expect much from those ears at first, I became immediately hooked the moment I put them in my ears. It outperformed the Gumiho and my old TinHifi P1 by far, and even out matches the FD5 my previous reference in this price range.
