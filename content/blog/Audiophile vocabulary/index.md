[A]{.text-3xl .font-bold #a}

[Airy]{.font-bold} – Describes the space and openness of the notes. Reproducing audio in a free, open and fresh manner around instruments and vocalists. Airy is not restricted only to the upper treble frequencies but is audible in the entire frequency range.

[ALAC]{.font-bold} – Apple Lossless Audio Codec – A reference audio coding implementation and format developed by Apple. Claimed that audio files compressed with this codec will be about half the file size of the original uncompressed data.

[Ambience]{.font-bold} – The overall impression, feeling, or mood evoked by an environment or acoustical space, such as the performance hall in which a recording was made.

[Amp/Amplifier]{.font-bold} – An electronic device that increases the power of, in this case, an analog signal to the output or speaker. It is a two-port electrical circuit that utilizes electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of the signal. Click here to shop amplifiers.

[Amplitude]{.font-bold} – The displacement of a wave from its mean value. In sound, it refers to the extent which air particles are displaced and is experienced as the loudness of sound. The higher the amplitude, the louder the sound.

[Analog]{.font-bold} (Audio) – Sound that has been recorded onto an analog medium like vinyl or tape. The recording on the medium, however, can have small imperfections that can cause audio artifacts in the playback.

[Analytical]{.font-bold} – Sound with a high emphasis on detail, achieved through a boosting of the high frequencies.

[APE]{.font-bold} – From Monkey’s Audio – A free and efficient high-resolution codec that provides lossless audio data compression. (APE files can be decompressed into identical copies of the original digital recording.) APE has better compression rates than FLAC but has limited support and is taxing to decode.

[ASP]{.font-bold} – Analog Signal Processing-An analog signal is one represented by a continuous stream of data, in this case along an electrical circuit in the form of voltage or current. Analog signal processing then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage, current or charge via various electrical means. Examples include crossover filters in loudspeakers, “bass, treble and volume” controls on stereos and “tint” controls on TVs. Also considered capacitors, resistors, and inductors (passive), and active elements such as transistors/operational amplifiers.

[Attenuator]{.font-bold} – A device or component that lowers the volume of an audio signal (example: volume control on an amplifier).

[Audiophile]{.font-bold} – An individual who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. An audiophile seeks to reproduce the sound of a live musical performance, typically in a room with great acoustics.


[B]{.text-3xl .font-bold #b }

[Balance]{.font-bold} – Refers to the tuning of a headphone. A well-balanced headphone would not have one particularly dominant frequency, but rather all would be “balanced.”

[Balanced]{.font-bold} (Audio) – a method of interconnecting audio equipment using impedance-balanced lines. Balanced connections use three-conductor connectors, usually an XLR or TRS jacks (a plus, a minus, and a ground). Using balanced audio can also reduce noise (especially) if using a long cable. 4-pin XLR, TRRS, and Pentaconn connections are the most commonly used balanced connectors for headphones. Standard XLR and TRS are balanced but you would typically need two of them for a pair of headphones (i.e. one TRS cable for the left ear cup and another for the right; the same would apply with 3-pin XLR connectors).

[Balanced Armature Driver]{.font-bold} – A type of driver most commonly used in hearing aids. Balanced armature drivers are designed to only reproduce a set part of the audible spectrum of sound, and as a result, are far more detailed in their sound reproduction within their set piece of the spectrum of sound. Because of this, it is generally necessary to use more than one balanced armature driver per earphone to cover the entire audible spectrum of sound. However, due to the need for a cross-over circuit to split the different parts of sound between the drivers, many would say that balanced armature drivers are less natural sounding than dynamic drivers.

[Bass]{.font-bold} – The lower end frequency of human hearing. Bass can be measured in quantity (heaviness) and quality (clarity). Other bass descriptors are “muddy” and “boomy.”

[Bit Rate]{.font-bold} – Refers to how much data is being stored per second (digital audio).

[Bit Depth]{.font-bold} – Refers to how much data is recorded per sample (digital audio). The more information (higher sample/bit rates and depth) the better quality and larger the file size, generally speaking.

[Bloat]{.font-bold} – A lack of definition and clarity in the mid-bass range. Overly-accentuated bass makes the signature sound heavy and poorly tuned. Bloat is commonly associated with dark, or overly warm, sound signatures.

[Bloom]{.font-bold} – A quality of expansiveness, richness, and warmth in music.

[BNC]{.font-bold} – A type of locking connector used for digital connections.

[Brain Tickle]{.font-bold} – An audio phenomenon that produces a warm, tingling sensation in the head that can travel down the spine. May be referred to as a brain massage.

[Breakup]{.font-bold} – When different points on the surface of a diaphragm begin to move out of sync, causing distortion. Breakup often occurs in dynamic drivers at high volumes as forces on the diaphragm increase. Breakup is less likely to occur at lower volumes or in planar magnetic or electrostatic headphone drivers.

[Bright/Brightness]{.font-bold} – A boost in the upper frequencies or upper-mid range. Brightness is a feature enjoyed by many but walks a thin line to becoming unpleasant due to a potential of treble peaking.

[Brilliance]{.font-bold} – High frequencies from 5kHz up to 20kHz. Not enough? Sound will be muddy. Too much? You'll hear hissing and sibilance.


[C]{.text-3xl .font-bold #c }

[Caps]{.font-bold} – Shorthand for a capacitor. Capacitors store energy inside a device temporarily, which can have a number of functions: in an amp power supply, DC coupling, tone controls, and filtering.

[Circum-aural]{.font-bold} – Refers to full-size headphones that fit over the ear.

[Clarity]{.font-bold} – Macro details in sound. You hear every sound distinctly.

[Coloration]{.font-bold} – the effect of a device on the music signal. The opposite of “neutral.” Various aspects can affect the tone, responsiveness or the frequency response of the music/audio.

[Congestion]{.font-bold} – Poor clarity caused by overlapping sounds. Congested sound signatures lack detail and clarity, making it hard to hear separate instruments and may also be called muddy or muffled.

Cranial Geometry – The unique contours of the human cranium that can impact a headphone’s “fit” or the level of comfort around the user’s head. This makes certain headphones a better fit for users with varying head shapes and sizes. If the geometry of the headphone does not align with a user’s unique head and ear geometry, this can impact the headphone’s “sealing condition,” and cause the sound to “leak” out. When this occurs, the headphone’s impressive sense of presentation and comfort-level may be compromised, entirely.

Crisp – Clear.

Critical Listening – A style of listening to music that focuses on microdetails and nuance.

Cups – Referring to the casing on the outer sides of the drivers on over/on-ear headphones. On closed-back headphones, they are referred to as “cups.” On open-back headphones, they are referred to as “grills.”

Customs – Shorthand for custom-fit in-ear monitors. Usually, custom fit impressions are made at an audiologist and sent to a factory to be made into molds which fit around the driver of the IEM. They result in a tighter fit and more exterior noise isolation. Also known as “CIEMs.”

D
D/A – Digital to Analog – A shorthand way to show the digital to analog conversion path.

DAC – Digital to Analog Converter – A device that converts digital data into an analog signal. Today, most audio is stored as digital data. So before being able to be heard through speakers, the DACs job is to convert this data into an analog signal which is then amplified to a speaker or headphone output. DACs are found in most of today’s electronics, but standalone or external DACs are usually far more superior than their internal factory counterparts. Read What is a DAC? to learn more.

DAP – Digital Audio Player – Simply put, a device that can play digital files. Higher-end DAPs include built-in, high quality digital to analog converters and headphone amps that can drive even power-hungry, high-end headphones. Not to be confused with an iPod or other standard MP3 playback devices (in this context), high fidelity DAPs can also play high-resolution format files like WAV and FLAC. Read What is a DAP? to learn more.

DSD – Direct Stream Digital – A trademark used by Sony and Philips for their system of digitally recreating audible signals for the Super Audio CD (SACD). The DSD coding system differs than that of its competitor: PCM. A DSD recorder uses delta-sigma modulation.

DSP – Digital Signal Processing – As audio signals may be represented in either digital or analog format, processing may occur in either domain. Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on the digital representation of that signal. A digital representation expresses the audio waveform as a sequence of symbols, usually binary numbers. This permits signal processing using digital circuits such as digital signal processors, microprocessors and general-purpose computers.

Dynamic Driver – The most common driver type, dynamic drivers are designed to be able to cover most of the spectrum of audible sound. They are typically larger and less detailed than their more expensive counterparts, balanced-armature drivers. They use a static magnetic field to oscillate the voice coil and create sound waves.

HiFi – High Fidelity – This term is often used to refer to the high-quality reproduction of sound.

HiFi v. LoFi – Generally speaking, if high fidelity is the accurate and realistic representation of the original recording, low fidelity would refer to when the sound quality is lower than the usual contemporary standard. The imperfections of the recording and production are audible, along with inconsistencies in notes, environmental interference and hardware imperfections are all appropriate and expected in a low fidelity environment.

High-end Audio – Refers to the sound equipment used by audiophiles; typically, well made for accurate reproductions of sound recordings. High-end components include turntables, digital to analog converters, equalization devices, preamps and amplifiers, speakers, subwoofers, etc. Acoustic room treatment is also considered since it does well at acoustically optimizing a designated space for listening.

HRA – High-Resolution Audio - Hi-Res Audio (HRA) is lossless audio capable of reproducing the full range of sound from recordings that have been mastered from better-than-CD quality music sources, a sound that closely replicates the quality that the musicians and engineers were working within the studio at the time of recording.

Impedance – Indicates how much power is required for the driver. The higher the impedance, the more power is required to get the maximum quality and volume of sounds out of the driver. Electrical resistance to the flow of current in an AC circuit. The higher the impedance of the headphone, for instance, the less current will flow through it.

Isolation – Created when a tight “sealing condition” around the ears effectively prevents sound from leaking out.

Back to Top

J
Jitter – A loss of a sample or block of samples in a bitstream during playback in a digital device, introducing noise. It can be caused by a number of factors including sync/word clock error or even buffer issues with the interface. Regardless, it happens with all digital devices and introduces noise, so that is why it’s important to have more data or higher quality recordings for playback to minimize jitter.

Judgement – A listener's assessment of how his or her perception of a sonic element measures up to their concept of perfection.

L
Layering – The reproduction of depth and receding distance, which audibly places the rows of performers one behind the other.

Listening Fatigue – A psychoacoustic phenomenon from prolonged listening to sound whose distortion content is too low to be audible as such but is high enough to be perceived subliminally. The physical and psychological discomfort can induce headaches and nervous tension.

Listening Style – The way a user prefers to listen to music. Typically, users may prefer to listen more analytically, or they may prefer to relax and “get lost” in the music. There’s no right or wrong way to listen to music.

Lossless – Refers to music file compression that does not remove data to compress the file. Examples include FLAC, WAV, MQA, etc.

Lossy – Refers to music file compression methods that remove the least audible sounds from music files to compress them. Compression cannot be reversed or uncompressed like in the case of lossless formats. Examples include MP3, AAC, Ogg, etc.

PCB – Printed Circuit Board – Electrical components are generally soldered onto the printed circuit board to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it. Used in most electronic products.

PCM – Pulse-Code Modulation – The standard form of digital audio in computers and CDs. It is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. A PCM stream has two properties that determine the stream’s fidelity to the original analog signal: the sampling rate, which is the number of times per second that samples are taken; and the bit depth, which determines the number of possible digital values that can be used to represent each sample.

Planar Magnetic Driver – Popular headphone driver featuring a series of magnets on both sides of a very large, flexible diaphragm containing tiny, electrically charged wires. Planar magnetic drivers are precise with a wider range but tend to be large and quite heavy. Magneplanar, isodynamic, and orthodynamic drivers all operate on this planar magnetic design.

Preamp/Preamplifier – The preamp acts as a switch, routing one or more signals to the amplifier. It reduces noise and interference while boosting the signal and adjusting the voltage for volume control to the amplifier. Preamplifiers also usually allow a user to switch between sources (radio, tape, CD, etc.). Click here to shop preamplifiers.
