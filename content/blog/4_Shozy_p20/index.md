title: Shozy P20 just landed on Linsoul

description: Shozy P20 is an innovative In-Ear Monitor (IEM) featuring a 14.5mm large diaphragm dynamic driver, a substantial upgrade from conventional 6-10mm diaphragms. This larger diaphragm not only delivers enhanced bass, akin to over-ear headphones, but also ensures superior sonic output with minimal distortion (THD under 0.5% at 1kHz).
