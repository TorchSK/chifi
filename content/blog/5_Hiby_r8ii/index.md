title: HiBy R8 II - Hi-End Android Digital Audio Player

description: Mobile Concert Hall. The R8 II is tuned in keeping with the “Portable Concert Hall” ethos of the original R8, but takes one step further, in filling out the large soundstage projected by the series with a new level of detail and density, truly bringing the openess and power of an orchestral performance into a portable listening environment, all thanks to the all-new Darwin-MPA architecture.
