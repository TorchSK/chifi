The Darwin-MPA, a continuation of the flexible design found in Darwin-R2R, shares many distinguishing features with its predecessor. In conjunction with internal delta-sigma modulators, input signals undergo 128x oversampling through the adaptable Darwin v2 filter system. This system can optionally emulate various non-oversampling DAC functionalities via the three built-in NOS filters or adopt a hybrid approach with the built-in Darwin Ultra filter. The oversampling (or non-oversampling) process follows a cascaded FIR design, featuring a highly precise 1024-tap opening stage.","model":"R8 ii","brand":"hiby","priceRange":"high","releaseDate":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","released":true,"new":true,"cover":"/hiby/r8ii/cover.webp","hero":"/hiby/r8ii/hero.webp","showInIndex":true,"features":["Processor Snapdragon 665 ensures smooth operation and quick response (8 GB RAM).","D/A Converter Darwin-MPA converts digital signals to analog with maximum fidelity.","PCM/DSD/MQA - The device supports sampling at 1536 kHz/32-bit, DSD1024, and MQA 16x.","Dual headphone outputs - 3.5mm and 4.4mm jacks for a wide range of headphones.","Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0, Wireless music streaming and network connectivity.","Open Android 12 system allows the installation of applications and streaming services.","Internal memory 256 GB.
